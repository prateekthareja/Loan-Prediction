## Description: 
A Housing Finance company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real time) based on customer detail provided while filling online application form. These details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others. To automate this process, they have given a problem to identify the customers segments, those are eligible for loan amount so that they can specifically target these customers. Here they have provided a partial data set.

#
I have built a model for this problem, which identifies the customer segment using given features(and some created features). A Random Forest algorithm was used for the same.
